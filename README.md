# TripAdvisor-Colone
Project Description
This project is a TripAdvisor-inspired webpage designed using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout. The page highlights travel destinations, reviews, and recommendations in a visually appealing format.

Key Features
HTML Structure: Semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> organize content for accessibility and SEO.

CSS Styling: Custom styles enhance typography, color schemes, and spacing to mimic a professional travel site.

Flexbox Layout: Flexible containers ensure responsive alignment of images, text, and review cards across devices.

Destination Cards: Each card displays an image, title, rating, and short description, styled neatly with Flexbox.

Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
